#### Requirements

For reporting purposes, it would be useful to have the ability to retrieve, for a given period of time (departure and arrival datetime interval, provided as request parameters), the list of the departure airports of all flights flying - partially or not - within this time range, and for each departure airport, the number of flights as well as the in-flight time for each aircraft. 
The in-flight time taken into account should be strictly within the time range, and the average time is expressed in minutes.
